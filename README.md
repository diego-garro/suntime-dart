of [suntime][suntime] library for Python.

## Features

- Get the local or custom time zone sunrise and sunset times.

## Usage

Once you import the library only instantiate the `Sun` class and 
use it methods.

```dart
import 'package:suntime/suntime.dart';

final latitude = 10.0;
final longitude = -84.0;

const sun = Sun(latitude, longitude);
const date = DateTime.now();

// Get today's sunrise and sunset in UTC for your machine.
const sunrise = sun.getSunriseTime(date: date);
const sunset = sun.getSunsetTime(date: date);
print('Sunrise: ${sunrise}');
print('Sunset: ${sunset}');

// Or get the same but for a special time zone location.
const tzSunrise = sun.getLocalSunriseTime('America/Halifax', date: date);
const tzSunset = sun.getLocalSunsetTime('America/Halifax', date: date);
print('Sunrise: ${tzSunrise}');
print('Sunset: ${tzSunset}');
```
